This is is a Social media website which brings all the people together who are interested in social works like environmental protection,pollution,etc.As we all know, there are some people out there who are willing to help us in these activities but these people doesnt get ample support.Well ! This website is a solution for this.
Our Website 'Social revolution' is a place where people who are willing to involve in the Social activities are able to seek help from other people or maybe any organisation through posts.The posts of the user comes like a news feed and those people or volunteers who can help these users can contact them or just comment beneath the post if they can be helpful to them.
